This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure

## Plan on improving the project

- Edit page so the separate sections are different pages rather than one simultanious page
- Add pictures for menu items to create visual representation for those who don't read English very well
