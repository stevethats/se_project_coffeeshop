# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

The basic structure allows for navigation through the site via the navigation bar, it allows the user to add input for creating a reservation at the coffee shop, and shows the proper use of the newely learned "transition" and "animation" properties to add to a more friendly GUI.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Edit page so the separate sections are different pages rather than one simultanious page
- Add pictures for menu items to create visual representation for those who don't read English very well
